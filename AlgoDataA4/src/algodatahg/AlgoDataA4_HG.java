/**
 * README.
 * 
 * Take a file as input and put in an EdgeWeightedGraph.
 * 
 * Then let user tell the program where he is at, where he is going to and 
 * where he would like to pass through.
 * 
 * Set the passing-vertex as the source vertex.
 * So it will be checking the paths:
 * passing -> starting, passing -> destination
 * 
 * Iterate through the path from passing -> starting:
 * What we really are looking for is the path starting -> passing. 
 * Since the data contains undirected edges we know
 * that the path from passing -> starting is also the path from starting -> passing.
 * The pathTo()-method returns a stack with path passing -> starting
 * To inverse the path, push every vertex to another stack.
 * Then pop every vertex of that new stack and enqueue each popped element to a queue.
 * 
 * Iterate through the path from passing -> destination:
 * Enqueue every vertex in the stack returned by the pathTo()-method to
 * the very same queue as used above.
 * 
 * Print path-queue.
